#Introduction

I'm learning about github now.

I've already mastered git (maybe), with github I can collaborate with others.

I've learned to

1. Create my github.com account
2. Create an SSH key
3. Uploaded the public SSH key to github
4. Cloned this github repository
5. Push a change to github
6. Pull changes from the class
7. Other stuff
