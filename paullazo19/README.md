# Introduction

I'm learning about github now.

I've already "mastered" git (maybe), with github I can collaborate with others.

I've learned to:

1.  Create my github.com account
2.  Create an SSH key
3.  Uploaded SSH key to github
4.  Cloned github repository
5.  Push a change to the github repository
6.  Pulled changes from the rest of the class
7.  Some of us had to merge
8. Read about "Github tema flow"
