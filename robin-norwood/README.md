# Introduction

I'm learning about github now.

I've already "mastered" git (maybe), with github I can collaborate with others.

I've learned to:

1. Create my github.com account.
2. Create an SSH key
3. Uploaded the public SSH key to github.
4. Cloned this github repository.
5. Push a change to the github repository.
6. Pulled changes from the rest of the class.
7. Some of us had to merge, but I didn't because I pushed my changes to master first.
8. Read about "Github team flow"

Next I'm going to:
1. Practice github team flow by pushing a branch and opening a pull request.
